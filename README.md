uml-acm-games
=============
Note that the code found here is (for now) the result of me (Jon) hacking blindly at it
over a weekend. The shape that this project will take is up for debate, and will hopefully 
be determined soon. Anyone with ideas, questions or concerns, please email me at notjonmadden@gmail.com.

IMPORTANT:
 > THIS PROJECT IS NOT YET ENDORSED BY UML ACM. I INTEND ON MAKING IT OFFICIAL ONCE
   WE HAVE COME TO AN AGREEMENT ON WHAT WE WANT THIS TO BECOME.
